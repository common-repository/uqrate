Member-curated comments, paid subscriptions and referrals, and broadcasting. This plugin is designed to generate revenue streams for content creators.

== Description ==

Uqrate monetizes your comments sections and increases your site's visibility. Your readers want to engage, and you want to get paid. Let's align those two wants. 

This plugin services your comments section, which is paired to a channel of your making at [Uqrate](https://uqrate.org). The purpose, design and dynamics of our platform is to lower the inertia of converting your followers to paid sponsors. It's a freemium-subscriptions model.

Though WordPress market share is spectacular (40%+) and growing, each of its content creators acts as a lone operator. That means your traffic is at the mercy of one or two gatekeepers and their momentary whims. This is an inversion of the open internet model, and is not good for anyone. 

By connecting to Uqrate through the plugin, the WordPress community forms a single-sign-on social network sans gatekeeper. Every member of the Uqrate society is a first-class citizen having the authority to moderate any comment replying to theirs. Hence the namesake: *You curate*.
